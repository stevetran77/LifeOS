## Technique Sessions

### Role Playing

**Scenario:** User acts as "Client" stating high-level intent ("I need to plan for the new year goal"), System acts as "Dynamic Orchestrator" calling expert agents.

**User Pain Point:** "I don't know *how* to plan effectively, or I don't have the energy to structure the process myself. I just want to state the goal and have the system guide me."

**Idea 1: The "CEO of Life" vs. "Staff" Dynamic**
- User is the executive with the vision.
- AI Agents are the staff/experts who execute, structure, and vet.
- Pain point solved: Operational overload and lack of strategic support.

**Idea 2: Dynamic Orchestration**
- User states intent: "Plan new year."
- System automatically identifies and calls the right "Strategic Planner" agent.
- Pain point solved: Friction of finding the right tool/template.

**Idea 3: Proactive Elicitation (The "Relief" Factor)**
- Agent asks high-value questions to structure the user's vague intent.
- *Potential Questions identified:*
    1. "Reflecting on this past year, what is the one thing you are most proud of and one thing you want to leave behind?" (Emotional context)
    2. "Are we focusing on a specific domain (Career, Health, Finance) or a holistic life balance?" (Scope definition)
    3. "How do you want to feel by the end of next year?" (Vision/Outcome focused)

**Idea 4: The Agent "Staff" Roster**
- Based on the BMAD 1.1 framework:
    - **[O] Orchestrator:** The Chief of Staff. Routes traffic, detects context (New Idea, Crisis, Review), and manages the lifecycle.
    - **[B] Brainstormer:** The Creative Consultant. Expands options, asks "what if," and ensures the user isn't locking in too early.
    - **[M] Mapper:** The Strategist. Turns ideas into specs, checks feasibility against constraints (time, money, energy).
    - **[A] Activator:** The Project Manager. Breaks plans into tasks, schedules them, and handles execution.
    - **[D] Debriefer:** The Analyst. Reviews performance, extracts lessons, and feeds insights back to the Strategist.

**Idea 5: Domain Expert Agents (The "Specialist" Layer)**
- Beyond the core process agents (B/M/A/D), the system needs **Domain Specialists**.
- **Financial Coach:** For income goals, budgeting, investment planning.
- **Health/Fitness Coach:** For physical goals, diet, training plans.
- **Career Mentor:** For promotion paths, skill acquisition, networking.
- **Relationship Coach:** For social goals, family planning, connection.
- **Orchestrator's Role:** Dynamically pulls in the *right* specialist based on the user's intent (e.g., "Increase income" -> calls Financial Coach).
